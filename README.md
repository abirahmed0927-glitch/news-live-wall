# news-live-wall
A Python-based tool that extracts live YouTube news streams and displays them in a CCTV-style grid view

YouTube Live News Grid Viewer is a Python application that automatically extracts live streams from multiple YouTube news channels and displays them simultaneously in a CCTV-style grid layout.

The project is designed to monitor multiple live news broadcasts at once, similar to a control room or surveillance dashboard. It fetches active live stream video IDs dynamically and embeds them into a responsive grid view, allowing all streams to play together without manual interaction.
